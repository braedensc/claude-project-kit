# The validator

The validator approves in your place, inside limits that code enforces. It may approve three
things: a plan, a piece starting, and a merge. Three layers must all agree first: hard limits in
code, the evidence, and one independent read-only agent. Anything missing, unsure or unreadable
holds. The design is `docs/adr/2026-11-05-the-validator-approves-inside-limits-that-code-enforces.md`.

This guide grows as the validator is built, one section per piece. Until the pieces that decide
are built, nothing is approved for you.

## 2. The ledger

Every decision the validator makes is one row in its ledger: what it decided, about what, and
why. Only the validator writes it. The stand-up, the weekly recap and the watcher will read it,
and the watcher will check every merge against it. Nothing writes rows yet: the pieces that
decide come next. The format is contract §23; the code is `scripts/pipeline_validator_ledger.py`.

| A row says | For example |
|---|---|
| What was decided, about what | a `merge`, of `acme/app#12` at its head |
| The decision | `approved`, `sent-back`, `escalated`, `escalated-urgent` or `held` |
| Each layer's verdict | hard limits `pass`, evidence `pass`, agent `pass` |
| Which switches were on, and the size limits | `approve-merges`; 400 lines, 20 files |
| The agent's reason, in its own words | `The diff does what the criteria ask, and nothing else.` |

**One verdict per head.** A row is never changed. A new push to a pull request is a new head,
and gets a new row.

**An approval is whole.** All three layers passed, and its own switch was on. A row that says
otherwise is refused, and nothing is written.

**The agent's words are quoted, never obeyed.** Its reason is one line of at most 300 characters,
with nothing hidden in it. It is the only text in the ledger.

**A ledger it cannot trust approves nothing.** It must be a plain file in your own home, outside
every repository, that only you can write. Anything else gives no rows, and says why. Good: no
ledger yet, which means nothing has been decided. Not that: `the ledger is inside a git working
tree, where a session can write, so no approval stands`. The install will set where it lives.
